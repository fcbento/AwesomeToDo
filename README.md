# AwesomeToDo

A nice web application to nicely manage your todo list. This one was created in order to improve my JavaScript skills, especially using some of the ES6 features and also to enhance how to organize my code. Particularly, on an overall basis, I didn't focus too much on both CSS and HTML while building this one, nonetheless the final outcome turned out to be reasonably satisfactory. It includes all CRUD operations using Node.js and MongoDB in the backend.

## Stack Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- Webpack, Bulma, npm
